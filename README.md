# QGIS: Making multiple maps for multiple locations (parameterisation)

This repo contains files and tipsheets for *parameterisation* in QGIS: that is, generating multiple maps based on a list of parameters (e.g. a list of lat-long locations)

## Files

You will need the following files:

1. A shape file of some sort, to create a map with. The example used is `AIMS_Spatial_Flood_Defences_inc_standardised_attributes.shp.zip` from the Spatial Information section of [AIMS Spatial Flood Defences (inc. standardised attributes)](https://environment.data.gov.uk/dataset/8e5be50f-d465-11e4-ba9a-f0def148f590)
2. A list of lat-longs for the places you want to generate map images for
3. A Python file containing the code to automate multiple image exports

## Walkthrough steps

1. [01_make_a_map.md](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/QGIS_parameterisation/blob/main/01_make_a_map.md) describes how to create a basic map in QGIS
2. [02_python.md](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/QGIS_parameterisation/blob/main/02_python.md) describes how to use a Python file to automate map image exports

## Optional files

You can use the following files to practise the processes above, and expand them:

* [defences_classification.csv](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/QGIS_parameterisation/blob/main/optionalfiles/defences_classification.csv) - this contains extra data about the defences that allows you to classify them and therefore use separate symbology in mapping.
* [QGISlocationsINDICES.csv](optionalfiles/QGISlocationsINDICES.csv) contains the lat/long locations of centre points in each UK local authority
* [gbcities.csv](optionalfiles/gbcities.csv) contains the lat/long locations of centre points in Great Britain's cities
* [Historic Flood Map](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/76292bec-7d8b-43e8-9c98-02734fd89c81/historic-flood-map1) contains other shape files that you can map - the file `DownloadHistoric_Flood_Map.shp.zip` is what you need to download
* [Flood Risk Areas](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/42c31542-228d-439b-8dbe-e72135dae71c/flood-risk-areas) contains more flood-related shape files: download `DownloadFlood_Risk_Areas.shp.zip` (click *Show more* if you can't see it)
* [Flood Map for Planning - Flood Zones](https://www.data.gov.uk/dataset/104434b0-5263-4c90-9b1e-e43b1d57c750/flood-map-for-planning-flood-zones1)
